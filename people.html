		<p>Mackenzie's PhD research focuses on understanding the demographic pathways and genetic consequences of range expansion. She is interested in expanding on current evolutionary theory that predicts negative fitness consequences resulting from range expansion--or expansion load--by developing new models and conducting empirical investigations using natural populations of <i>Erythranthe lewisii</i> along contrasting spatiotemporal scales (e.g., latitudinal and elevational gradients). Specifically, she aims to identify when and where we would expect the accumulation of expansion load to negatively impact long-term persistence of edge-populations in nature, which has implications for population-level responses to climate change.</p>

		<p>Takuji is interested in the eco-evolutionary processes that govern changes to species distributions. In response to environmental change, he is interested in the role of: (1) selective and stochastic evolutionary processes; and (2) species interactions in determining population dynamics at both the leading edge (e.g. range expansion) and trailing edge (e.g. evolutionary rescue) of the species range. In addition to these disequilibrial dynamics, he is further interested in the demographic and genetic processes that shape equilibrial (i.e. fitness and niche limited) range limits. To explore these themes, Takuji is currently setting up a novel, lab replicated species ‘range’ using multiple coexisting species of duckweed. Through utilizing experimental evolution, he will run lab experiments to study the effects of evolution on range dynamics in real time.</p>

		<br />
   	      Currently: Assistant Professor at Concordia University </p>
		<p>My general interest lies at the interface of environmental sciences and evolutionary biology and involves life history plasticity, dispersal ecology, sexual selection, and conservation biology.
My current research  focuses on  changes in the distribution range of odonates across latitude and elevation in Europe. My main questions are: what drives the variability in the range shift of species? How can we predict future range dynamics of communities? How species respond to climate change across different geographic gradients.<br />
My previous postdoc research, which was conducted with Prof. Stefan Lüpold at UZH, focuses on understanding whether female choice depends on intrinsic male quality or male-female genetic compatibility. I am also interested in how toxins (pesticides) change female choice, male performance, genetic compatibility and ultimately sexual selection. To this end, I use laboratory experiments on <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. With my team consisting of postdocs and PhDs in Algeria, we carry out regular surveys to characterize the odonatological and avian fauna of the country and identify the threats that endanger the persistence of species. We also use citizen science and take into account the cultural aspect of society to effectively come up with solutions to establish effective conservation plans.

		<p>Barb worked on the physiolgoy and conservation of Limber pine (<em>Pinus flexilis</em>). She measured  needle traits and quantified their variation and distribution along a latitudinal gradient to determine if they can be used as predictors of resistance to an invasive rust (<em>Cronartium ribicola</em>).</p>

          Research Associate, University of British Columbia, 2012-2013<br />
          Currently: Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Dublin</p>
        <p>Anna  asks: How are population dynamics are affected by environmental variability? What are the mechanisms linking traits, environment and biotic interactions to spatial population dynamics? Can the variation in <br />
demographic rates be  predicted from the position of populations <br />
within the geographic range and within ecological niche space? Which demographic rates may signal persistent or shifting geographic ranges? She answers these questions by linking  range-wide variation in population dynamics to spatially explicit predictions of habitat suitability.  <br />

        Post Doc, Colorado State University, 2008-2012 <br />
        Currently: Assistant Professor, University of San Francisco</p>
      <p>John uses a coalescent framework to infer demographic histories across species' ranges and test competing range limit hypotheses. His prior work examined species distribution and abundance from a phylogenetic perspective, asking if age is related to range size and how phylogenetic relatedness structures assemblages. </p>

    <p>Erin's project  involved examining maternal effects in long-lived plant species <br />
      to better account for the impact of the maternal environment during offspring development on early seedling growth. She also explored the degree of genetic differentiation among limber pine populations in the Southern Rocky Mountains to help improve the success of conservation actions.</p></div>
